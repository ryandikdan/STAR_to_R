# STAR_to_R

Here's a small function to import the ReadsPerGene output from STAR alignment with the geneCounts flag on for RNA-seq analysis into R. 
I found this difficult in the past and didn't see a package to do so, and while I'm no expert, this seems to work.

Feel free to take this code and edit as you see fit. Let me know if there are any bugs or requests.
